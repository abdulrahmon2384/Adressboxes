# Adressboxes
Okay, it's boring, but here's your exercise for today:
Create an addressbook program using the bourne or bourne-again shell.
It should use functions to perform the required tasks. It should be menu-based, allowing you the options of:

   . Search address book
   . Add entries
   . Remove / edit entries

You will also need a "display" function to display a record or records when selected.
