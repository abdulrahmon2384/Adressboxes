# Addressboxes
Okay, it's boring, but here's your exercise for today:
Create an addressbook program using the bourne or bourne-again shell.
It should use functions to perform the required tasks. It should be menu-based, allowing you the options of:

  (Search address book)
  (Add entries)
  (Remove / edit entries):

You will also need a "display" function to display a record or records when selected.
